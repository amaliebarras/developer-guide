There are three parts to this documentation, which increase in complexity.

1. Editing pages: this only contains info relevant to editing pages. You'll learn what to do, but not how or why.

2. Setting up pages: this contains the workflow for setting up a new project. You'll understand the pages ecosystem a little better, but you won't be fluent in github.

3. Github for pages users: this page follows an official beginner's guide published by github, and supplements it with information relative to the pages ecosystem.
